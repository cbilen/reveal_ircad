##  **SyN** and **SF**

* <p class="fragment fade-up">**SyN** is already demonstrated to be performing well for deformable image registration</p>
* <p class="fragment fade-up">We propose to combine the **SyN** algorithm with the **SFs** for more robust and improved image registration for Liver CT</p>
* <p class="fragment fade-up">The use of **SF** is complementary to the advatages of **SyN**, hence almost no drawback</p>
